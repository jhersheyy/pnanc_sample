TO DO:
test page
styling
	check header spacing (pretty text right side, container fit??)
	add section tldr for how to, separate pop up disclaimer

cli order
rm -rf dist
npm run build
npm run start
rm -rf dist
git add .
git commit -m "whatevs"
git push heroku master
heroku ps:scale web=1
heroku open
(rm -rf dist)
git push

---old shtuff---


seeing if/when styling gets applied by looking thru css files
try setting modules=true under export rule for scss

where i was at: check error bc theres a ref issue with index js bc of the client side or server side and it not having the same eimages at the bottom =\ or sth?????
^ok i think i fixed that but like now theres no error AND it doesnt work =\
elaborate on non root pages: about nlp, test articles <-also
