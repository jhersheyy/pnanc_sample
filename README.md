# pnanc_sample
before and after images of PNANC website, using wild apricot platform- uses some template styling and some custom css styling

## PNANC Folder
This folder contains screenshots of the website I was restyling, so you can see
 what it looked like before I touched anything. PNANC stands for Philippines 
 Nurses Association of Northern California, and they were looking for a cleaner,
 more professional look. 
 
 The screenshots do not show hover behaviors. There are very limited responsive/
 resizing changes.
 
 ## PNATest Folder
 This folder contains screenshots of the website I styled using the contents of
  the original websites. The contents have not been proofread for errors and 
  redundancies yet! Also, not all images were not made available, so I used
  screenshots of the images instead for some. Some features, like membership 
  or donation pages, were also not available because I have been using the free
  version of the website template.
  
  Only the About Us page has proper functionality for the side menu (for 
  same-page links). Not all content has been added to this website yet, because 
  it's still just a sample.
  
  ## Wild Apricot [(Click here for their website)](https://www.wildapricot.com/)
  Wild apricot is a website management tool. The association's current website
  is already based on Wild Apricot, so I just used it to make sure the transfer
  can be smooth.
  
  I first picked a pre-styled theme with templates, and then edited them to my 
  liking. I added content and then added more styling, either through the 
  template settings and customizations or with my own css.
